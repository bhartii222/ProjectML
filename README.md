# ProjectML
Analysis Of Performance Variation On IoT Attacks On Different Dataset Size (Using ML)               

Requirements:
To run this project, you need the following software and libraries installed on your system:
1. Python 3.x
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Scikit-learn
4. Pandas
5. Numpy
6. Matplotlib
7. openpyxl

Dataset:
We use the attack (class type1 and class type 2) and non-attack datasets, which are generated
through the net sim stimulator for intrusion detection in IoT devices. The different size datasets
are 1:1 which is balanced, 1:2 is slightly imbalanced, and 1:3 which is an imbalanced dataset.
Each of them contains 12 types of features and we use these dataset for our analysis.

Project Structure:
The project has the following files:
1. attack_detection_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook that contains the code for
machine learning algorithms, data visualization, and performance analysis.
2. .csv: Dataset file in CSV format.
3. README.md: Readme file for the project.
Usage:
To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local system.
2. Open the attack_detection_analysis.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the code cells in the notebook.
4. The notebook generates performance metrics and visualizations for machine learning
algorithms with different dataset sizes
